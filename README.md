# Health & Wellbeing Website – Static Group Project

This project was one of my first proper web development projects, completed as part of a group assignment for the Advanced Certificate: Computing with Software Development and Cyber Security (SCQF Level 6) at college.<br>
The site’s content is organized by day of the week, with each day focusing on a specific wellness theme. There are seven main content pages (Monday through Sunday), plus a central homepage and an interactive quiz. Each page is carefully designed to be clear, accessible, and mobile-friendly. The project was meant to show our ability to design and code a complete website from scratch, with a focus on structure, layout, and basic responsive design.

Even though it was a group task, I was responsible for the full design and coding of the website.

## About the Project

The aim of the website was to **promote health and wellbeing**, and to practise building a clean, informative, and user-friendly static site. The website doesn't have any back-end or database—it’s a front-end only prototype designed to demonstrate:

- Good structure and layout
- Clear navigation
- Relevant content related to health and wellbeing
- A responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile

It was also a great opportunity to get hands-on with basic HTML and CSS and focus on user experience.

## Learning Experience

As my first website project, I gained a lot of confidence in building layouts from scratch, writing clean HTML/CSS, and thinking about how users interact with a site. It was also my first experience taking full ownership of a project's front-end, and I really enjoyed turning ideas into a finished, working product.
