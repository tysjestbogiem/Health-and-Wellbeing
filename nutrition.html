        <p>Welcome to Nutrition Tuesday! Today we’ll discuss the importance of proper nutrition and some tips for a healthy, balanced diet.<br>
        Proper nutrition is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. A healthy, balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that our bodies need to function properly, fight off disease, and maintain a healthy weight.</p>
        <p><img src="images/nutririon.png"><br>Here are some tips for a healthy, balanced diet:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Eat a Variety of Foods: Aim to include a variety of foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Eating various foods ensures you get all the necessary nutrients your body needs.</li>
        <li>Choose Whole Foods: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible. These foods are generally more nutritious and contain fewer additives and preservatives than processed foods.</li>
        <li>Limit Processed and Sugary Foods: Processed foods and sugary drinks are often high in calories, sodium, and unhealthy fats. Limiting these foods can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.</li>
        <li>Stay Hydrated: Drinking enough water is important for overall health and can help regulate appetite and prevent dehydration. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day.</li>
        <li>Practice Portion Control: Pay attention to serving sizes and practice portion control. Eating too much of even healthy foods can lead to weight gain.</li></ul>
        <p>Remember, a healthy, balanced diet is just one part of overall health and well-being. Regular physical activity, stress management, and enough sleep are important components of a healthy lifestyle.<br>
        Incorporating these tips into your daily routine can help improve your nutrition and overall health. Eat various foods, choose whole foods, limit processed and sugary foods, stay hydrated, and practice portion control. You can develop healthy habits that will benefit you for years by making small changes over time.</p>

        <h3>The Eatwell Guide</h3>
        <p>The Eatwell Guide shows how much of what we eat overall should come from each food group to achieve a healthy, balanced diet.<br>
        You do not need to achieve this balance with every meal, but try to get the balance right over a day or even a week.<br>
        Most of us still are not eating enough fruit and vegetables. They should make up just over a third of the food we eat each day. <br>
        Aim to eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg each day. Choose from fresh, frozen, tinned, dried or juiced.<br><br><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/" target="_blank" class="read-more-link">Read more</a>

        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.<br>

        If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.</p><br><br>
